### Brooklyn Music Venues is a submission for the final project in the Udacity Front End Developer Nano Degree

This project uses two react packages:
- React-Google-Maps: one of the most helpful documentations I have come across
- Recompose: recommended in the above documentation for ease of use

The Maping and Data come from two API's:
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Foursquare API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Setup and Run

This application is easy to use, just download or clone this repository, then run "npm install" before "npm start" and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
